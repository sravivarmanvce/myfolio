I am a Masters student recently graduated in ”Information and Communication Engineering” course at TU Darmstadt,Germany. I have a final grade of 1.78 in my Masters with a Thesis focusing on Analog CMOS design. Since I have finished my degree, I am currently looking for new opportunities and am available immediately. I have a varied hardware/ software development experience, I enjoy coding and solving difficult challenges.
